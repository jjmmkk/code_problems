# [King's Gold](http://www.problemotd.com/problem/kings-gold)

> Many, many moons ago there was a fair king who oversaw 10 villages. As the
> king, he required a village tax of 1 gold bar per day per village. Each gold
> bar is supposed to weigh 1000g and have the village name etched in to it.
> However, the king has learned through an informant that one village has been
> cheating him the whole time and only giving him a bar that weighs 999g.
>
> The king is furious and orders a scale to be brought in to test the weight of
> the gold bars. Assuming the king has access to all the gold bars ever sent to
> him, how can he figure out which village has been cheating him the whole time
> by using the scale _only once_?
